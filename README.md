# BOM Squad: Inventory & Search Tool for DIY Eurorack Synthesizer Modules

Welcome to **BOM Squad**, a tool designed to simplify the process of building DIY audio hardware. BOM Squad helps users explore project, manage their component inventory, and streamline the sourcing and assembly process.

## Live Site

Access the latest live version of BOM Squad, complete with ongoing updates, at [https://bom-squad.com/](https://bom-squad.com/). This version includes the newest features, bug fixes, and improvements. Explore modules, track your inventory, and connect with the DIY audio community through the live site.

## Features

-   **Module Management**: Explore DIY modules, add them to your list of completed or "to build" projects, and catalog required components.
-   **Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of the components you have on hand, organize by location, and avoid duplicate purchases.
-   **Smart Shopping Lists**: Generate optimized shopping lists across builds, track quantities, and compare prices from suppliers like [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) and [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/).
-   **Component Reviews**: View and contribute community feedback on specific components for given builds.
-   **Version History**: Keep a log of your inventory changes, easily reverting to a previous state when needed.
-   **Dark Mode for Soldering**: Enables a comfortable workspace mode for soldering sessions with reduced eye strain.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: Django, PostgreSQL, Docker
-   **Frontend**: React bundled via Webpack, integrated within the Django project
-   **Deployment**: Configured for DigitalOcean with Nginx, AWS S3 for static/media file storage
-   **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## TypeScript Integration 
Plans BOM Squad is transitioning to TypeScript to enhance code reliability, improve developer experience, and add static type-checking to the frontend codebase. The migration will be gradual: 
1. **Initial Refactor**: Key components and utility functions will be refactored to TypeScript over the next year. 
2. **Component-Based Migration**: Each React component will be updated to TypeScript as modifications are made.
3. **Documentation and Types**: Custom types and interfaces will be documented to facilitate future contributions. As TypeScript is introduced, contributors are encouraged to use TypeScript for any new components or features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Docker**: Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to manage and run containers.
-   **Node.js**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for managing frontend dependencies.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    
	```
	git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
	cd project
	```
    
2.  **Prepare Environment Variables**:
    
    -   Rename `.env.example` to `.env.dev` and populate necessary secrets like `SECRET_KEY`, API keys, and database credentials for local development.
3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:  
    In the project root, install Node dependencies for bundling:
	```
	npm install
	```
4.  **Build and Bundle the Frontend**: Use the following Make commands to bundle frontend assets and prepare them for integration with Django:
    
	 ```
	    make build-styles
	    make cp-bundle
	```
    
5.  **Build the Docker Containers**: With Docker Desktop running, build the backend and database containers:
   	 ```
    docker-compose build
	```    
6.  **Start the Application**: Start the application in development mode:
	```
	docker-compose up
	```  
    
7.  **Access the Application**:
    
    -   Frontend and backend integrated: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Loading Test Data

To quickly populate the database with test data for development:

1.  **Find the Backend Container ID**:
	 ```   
	docker ps
	 ```   
2.  **Enter the Django Backend Container**: Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID from the previous step:
	```  
	docker exec -it <container_id> bash
	``` 
3.  **Load Test Data**: Inside the container, run:
	```
	./manage.py loaddata fixtures/test_data.py
	```

## Frontend Build with Webpack

The frontend code is bundled using Webpack, and assets are moved directly to Django static directories:

-   **Environment Variables** are managed using Dotenv (`.env` file).
-   **Makefile Integration**: Automates the compilation of styles and JavaScript bundles, preparing assets for production.

To rebuild and re-bundle the frontend:
```
make build-styles
make cp-bundle 
```
### Running Tests

To ensure the codebase remains stable, we encourage running tests regularly.

-   **Backend Tests**:
    
    `docker exec -it <container_id> ./manage.py test` 
    
-   **Frontend Tests**:  
    Run `npm test` in the root for any unit or integration tests defined.
